üîç **Linux System Information and Vulnerability Scanner** is a powerful and user-friendly tool written in Bash that allows you to fetch comprehensive system information and vulnerabilities from your Linux system. This tool creates a `data.json` file containing all the relevant data, which can then be easily visualized on a web page.
